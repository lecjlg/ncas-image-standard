# Example template for demonstrating the ExifTool handler software available
# from https://github.com/dahooper/exiftool-handler
#
# Note that this example has been designed to demonstrate different aspects
# of a template file rather than to embed useful metadata. 
#
# Each file requires a "template_id" entry

- template_id: module_exiftool_example_template

- XMP-photoshop:Headline: This is a short value, which can fit on one line.
#
# The following entry contains substitution fields for string and float
# values.

- XMP-dc:Description: |
    This is a longer value, which not only extends beyond the length of
    one line, but extends to more than one paragraph. Here's an
    example of how to substitute the word {string_substitution} into the
    text. An entry for "string_substitution" will be required in the
    substitutions dictionary.
      There is no need to include a format specification within a
    substitution field if the default formatting achieves the desired
    result. This is likely to be the case for string and integer
    substitution values. In the case of floating point values, the
    default formatting will include as many decimal places as are
    required to represent the number without a loss of precision, e.g.
    {float_substitution}. However, a format specification can added if
    you would prefer fewer decimal places, e.g. {float_substitution:.2f}.
#
# The following entry
#   a) makes use of the "global" substitution value __utcnow__
#   b) must be enclosed within inverted commas since it begins with a "{"
#
- XMP-xmp:CreateDate: "{__utcnow__:%Y:%m:%d %H:%M:%S}"
#
# The following entry
#   a) makes use of the "global" substitution value __utcnowstr__, which
#      does not need a format specification
#   b) must be enclosed within inverted commas since it begins with a "{"
#
- XMP-dc:Date: "{__utcnowstr__}"
#
# The values of the following fields must also be enclosed within inverted
# commas to ensure that they are interpreted as string types

- XMP-iptcExt:LocationShownGPSLatitude: "52.424500"

#
# Multiple values can be assigned to list tags in two ways. The first requires
# each value to be on a separate line, to be indented more than tag name, and
# to preceded with a dash and a single space "- ".

#
# The second way to assign multiple values to a list tag is to enclose them
# within square brackets and to separate them from each other by a comma
# followed by a space. This syntax should only be used if all of the values
# can fit on one line.
